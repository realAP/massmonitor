## Philosophy
The main reason for this Project is to learn and have fun.

There is no higher Architecture or Requirements. The design philosophy is "code by intension".
There is a german esay with the title "Über die allmähliche Verfertigung der Gedanken beim Reden", i like the headline.
The deeper sense is, when you vocalize your thoughts then you are ordering it and make it clearer for yourself.
That's the idea behind "coding by intension".
